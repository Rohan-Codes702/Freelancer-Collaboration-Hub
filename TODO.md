# TODO: Make Project Responsive for Mobile

- [x] Update `src/App.jsx` to add state for sidebar open/close and pass it to `Sidebar` and `Header`
- [x] Modify `src/Components/Header.jsx` to add a hamburger menu button (3 lines) visible only on mobile, which toggles the sidebar
- [x] Update `src/Components/Sidebar.jsx` to conditionally show as an overlay on mobile when open, and hide on close. Add close functionality on navigation links
- [x] Ensure on PC (md+), the sidebar remains as is (always visible)
- [x] Run the development server to test responsiveness on mobile and PC
- [x] Verify sidebar toggles correctly and closes on link clicks
